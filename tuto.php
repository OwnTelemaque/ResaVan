        <p>How does this work?
        <br />
        This is the calendar showing the next 2 weeks with the available spots to go to Eldons or any hardware shop with the morning or afternoon van.<br />

            <p>Green: A van is already booked by Suzie. Seats still available. Consider it ready to go.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Grey: Suzie hasnâ€™t booked anything at that stage but you still can show your will to go that day. Hopefully more people will join you. Ultimately Suzie might have to move you to another spot.</p>

        <p>To book a seat, simply click on the day you wish to go.<br />
            Your name will then appear with a red cross near to it: <img height="18px" src="images/del.png" id="iconeHome" alt="home" /> Use it if you want to cancel your reservation.<br />
        <br />
        Vans to the hardware stores: Suzie tries as much as possible to organize people willing to go on these longer trips together. You can easily see who is already willing to go by spotting the little wrench on the side: <img height="18px" src="images/clef.png" id="iconeHome" alt="home" /><br />
